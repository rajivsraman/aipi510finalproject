## Executive Summary

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool that facilitates magnetic resonance imaging, chemical fingerprinting, and quantification of metabolic processes.  The fields of medicine, chemistry, and biomedical engineering have benefited tremendously from applications of NMR-based technology. However, NMR signal is dictated by the inherently low difference in spin-up and spin-down populations (~3 in 100,000 proton spins at 10 T and 25°C), limiting the sensitivity. A variety of NMR “hyperpolarization” techniques have been developed to overcome this low sensitivity by increasing the spin population difference, thereby enhancing polarization to provide higher NMR signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is a new and inexpensive NMR hyperpolarization technique that transfers polarization from parahydrogen onto a target nucleus via an organometallic catalyst. The advent of “SABRE in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei” (SABRE-SHEATH) unlocked the realm of low-field manipulation by eliminating influence from the Earth’s magnetic field. SABRE-SHEATH functions by uniting an iridium-based catalyst, a target ligand, parahydrogen, and a stabilizing co-ligand in a chemical reaction under the influence of magnetic fields. Immediately after a SABRE-SHEATH experiment is run, an NMR spectrum taken on the ligand will exhibit a significant augmentation in SNR. Through such NMR hyperpolarization techniques, scientists have revolutionized science both inside and outside of the clinic.

Dr. Warren S. Warren's lab at Duke University has developed a robust package in Wolfram Mathematica (DMExFR2) that enables highly accurate simulations
